# An API and a start-up package for creating bots for GEOSTEERING competion the NORCE way

## To create your own bot

To create your own bot modify and run simple_client.py which shows the uses of essential features of the API.

client_with_charackter.py replays results of the GEOSTEERING competion the NORCE way from 2019, which are also included in the repository.

## To test the system with GUI

Run redirect_client_server.py

It creates a copy of the web interface (GUI) of the competition at 127.0.0.1:9000 (check the port).

## Other issues

To request help with development of bots, please create an issue.
